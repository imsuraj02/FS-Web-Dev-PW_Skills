//2. What are HTML Entities? List out 5 commonly used entities.

HTML entities are special codes used in HTML to represent characters and symbols that have special meanings or reserved uses in HTML or might not be displayed correctly by some browsers. These entities ensure that such characters are displayed correctly in web pages and do not interfere with the HTML markup. Here are five commonly used HTML entities:

1. &lt; - Less Than Sign (<):

Entity: &lt;
Character: <
Usage: This entity is used to display the less than sign ("<") in HTML text without being interpreted as the beginning of an HTML tag.

2. &gt; - Greater Than Sign (>):

Entity: &gt;
Character: >
Usage: This entity is used to display the greater than sign (">") in HTML text without being interpreted as the end of an HTML tag.

3. &amp; - Ampersand (&):

Entity: &amp;
Character: &
Usage: This entity is used to display the ampersand character ("&") in HTML text without being interpreted as the start of an HTML entity.

4. &quot; - Double Quotation Mark ("):

Entity: &quot;
Character: "
Usage: This entity is used to display double quotation marks (") in HTML text, especially within attribute values of HTML elements.

5. &apos; - Single Quotation Mark ('):

Entity: &apos;
Character: '
Usage: This entity is used to display single quotation marks (') in HTML text, especially within attribute values of HTML elements. Please note that this entity is not as widely supported as &quot;, so it's often safer to use ' directly.
