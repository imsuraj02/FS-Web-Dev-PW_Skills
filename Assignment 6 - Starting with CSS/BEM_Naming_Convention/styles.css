/* In the CSS above:

1) The "paragraph-block" class represents the base styling for the main block element, which includes font size and margin.
2) The "paragraph-block--important" class is a modifier class that indicates an important paragraph. It modifies the font weight and color.
3) The "paragraph-block__sub" class represents a sub-element within the main block. It applies italic styling and a different text color.

With this structure, we have used BEM naming conventions:

a) "paragraph-block" represents the main block.
b) "paragraph-block--important" is a modifier class to modify the main block.
c) "paragraph-block__sub" is a sub-element within the main block. */
