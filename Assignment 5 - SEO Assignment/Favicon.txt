//5. Define Favicon and give on illustrative example.

A favicon (short for "favorites icon" or "shortcut icon") is a small, typically square image or icon associated with a website. It is displayed in various places within web browsers to represent a website, such as in browser tabs, bookmarks, history lists, and sometimes in address bars. Favicons help users visually identify and distinguish websites when they have multiple tabs or bookmarks open.

Here's how to define a favicon in an HTML document using the <link> element in the document's <head> section:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="favicon.png">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your website content goes here -->
</body>
</html>

In this example:

The <link> element is used with the rel attribute set to "icon" to specify that this is a favicon.
The type attribute specifies the file format of the icon. In this case, it's "image/png" for a PNG image, but other formats like "image/jpeg" or "image/gif" can also be used.
The href attribute specifies the path to the favicon image file, which is "favicon.png" in this example.
The favicon image file, "favicon.png" in this case, should be a small square image, typically 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels in size. It should be visually distinctive and represent the website or brand effectively in a small format.

Once added to the HTML document, the favicon will be displayed in browser tabs and other relevant places when users visit the website, making it easier for them to recognize and access the site.
